## Wish list

Here are some things that could be added or improved!

* Cohort criteria. At present, students are assigned to sessions on a first-come basis. 
Thus discussion group membership is essentially random conditional on availability. 
However, it would be desirable to allow the instructor to condition grouping on other criteria, 
such as demographic variables or prior performance measures.  
This would enable the instructor to manage group composition, e.g. hetero/homogeneity.

* Synchronization control. 
It may be desirable to prevent students from getting ahead of others in their group, 
perhaps by conditioning subsequent screens on a "ready" button of sorts.

* Auto-completion. In the case that group sizes larger than two are preferred, 
the instructor might still want to allow an undersized group to proceed. 
An option could be checked that would permit the system to auto-complete the chat room 
after a certain elapsed time provided at least two participants are present.

* Graphic enhancement. 
Differentiating users by color would be a good enhancement for visibility. 
Also, the logout button might be relocated to the top. 
At present, the log out button disappears into the scroll buffer requiring 
users to scroll back through the chat in order to log out of the chat session.

* Intelligent support. Hey, while you're at it, it would be great to have a really smart
AI to adaptively facilitate discussions between students.
