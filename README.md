# Collaborative Problem Solving Xblock (CPSX)

The purpose of this Xblock is to allow small groups of 2, 3 or more to work on a set of edX problems together through real-time chat. The problems in the assignment can be any type of edX problem, e.g. numerical input, drag-and-drop, etc. 

## Instructor-Side Experience

The instructor creates in Studio a new CPS Unit assignment and decide the following:
* (a) the size of a collaboration cohort (Group Size), e.g. 2 or 3 students
* (b) the Wait Time, e.g. 5 minutes


## Student-Side Experience

* Student logs into the course and navigates to a collaborative Homework unit in the courseware. 

* Student gets to a screen an explanation previously written by the instructor. Sample:

“This is a collaborative homework assignment. You are expected to work together with a partner to answer the following 
10 questions. Your partner will be assigned automatically from another student who is online. If no one is online, 
the system will wait 5 minutes for another student to join. Once you and your partner are both ready to start, you will begin. 
Click Ready to start.”

* Student clicks Ready. A countdown timer begins counting down for 5 minutes to wait for partners. He sees a message: "Waiting for partners to chat with. Time left..." 

Then at some point the student sees the message, “Ok! Your partner is ready. Click Begin to start the assignment.” The Ready button is now Begin. When he hits Begin that chat is automatically displayed. 

* However, If no one else appears online at the end of 5 minutes (or any other time determined by the instructor on the Studio authoring tool), the student will get a message “Sorry, nobody else is online now. Would you like to wait another 5 minutes? If so, click on the Restart button.” The Ready button is now Restart.

* If a student loses his internet connection and has to log back in, ideally he should be allowed back to the collaborative portion where he dropped off.
