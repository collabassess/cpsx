INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS 

0. We will try to do all of this starting from a barebones Ubuntu installation using
the cypress release (see here for updated information
https://github.com/edx/configuration/wiki/edX-Ubuntu-12.04-64-bit-Installation)

On Amazon, if using a community Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit AMI, it is necessary to expand the
root partition before launching. The default is 8GB. Make it at least 25GB (preferance is 50GB). 

The remainder assumes that the following instance is launched with sufficient storage:

AMI ID ubuntu-precise-12.04-amd64-server-20150401 (ami-00615068)

Connect to the remote server

sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo reboot

export OPENEDX_RELEASE=named-release/cypress
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edx/configuration/master/util/install/sandbox.sh -O - | bash


1. To set up the virtual host without interfering with other OpenEdX ports, 
we will use port 4444

sudo apt-get install apache2

On OpenEdX, apache installation will fail because port 80 is already in use by nginx.
Modify /etc/apache2/ports.conf (replace with included version)
Add the file chatapp.conf to /etc/apache2/sites-available
and then symlink it to sites/enabled
> cd /etc/apache2
> sudo ln -s sites-available/chatapp.conf sites-enabled/chatapp

Then this should work to start the virtual host
> sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start


2.
Create a MySQL DDBB and import the structure from the sql.dump

> mysql -u root
>> create database ajax_chat;

3.
Dump MySQL structure to the new created DDBB, 
https://github.com/iblstudios/CPSX-xBlock/blob/master/chatapp/mysql-dump/sql.dump
We will need to git clone anyway to install the XBlock, so do this

cd /edx/app/edxapp
sudo -u edxapp git clone https://github.com/ybergner/CPSX-xBlock.git

$mysql -u root
>> ajax_chat < /edx/app/edxapp/CPSX-xBlock/chatapp/mysql-dump/sql.dump


4.
Point the xblock vars inside the new virtual server,
https://github.com/iblstudios/CPSX-xBlock/blob/master/xblock/ibltutoringchat/IBLTutoringChat.py

[Still don't know exactly what this means]
[Edit, that's because it was the wrong file]


The following error will occur if you do nothing in this step and do step 5. When you 
try to attach a CPSX object in Studio, you get

Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/edx/app/edxapp/venvs/edxapp/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ibltutoringchat/public/html/ibltutoring.html'

The following quick fix resolves this error, but does not make the CPSX object actually 
appear in the courseware (careful about capitalization of xblock and xBlock in the repo name)

$ sudo cp -r /edx/app/edxapp/CPSX-xblock/xblock/ibltutoringchat/public/ /edx/app/edxapp/venvs/edxapp/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ibltutoringchat/



5.

https://github.com/iblstudios/CPSX-xBlock/tree/master/xblock
Install the XBlock
cd /edx/app/edxapp && sudo -u edxapp /edx/bin/pip.edxapp install CPSX-xBlock/xblock/

Need to add this line to cms.envs.json under FEATURES

"ALLOW_ALL_ADVANCED_COMPONENTS": true,

Then, of course, need to add "cpsx" to list of advanced modules in course.
